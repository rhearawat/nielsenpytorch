A) Ensure that the training_data[k:k+mini_batch_size] has different images
mini_batch has 10 images as below
ie training_data[0]
   training_data[1]
   ...
   training_data[9] are different data points
   
[DONE] They are all different data.



B) In update_mini_batch: we are iterating over 10 images that consitute the mini_batch ie
  for x, y in mini_batch:
  Noet: x is the image data ie (784,1) and y is (10,1)
  
C) Ensure that in backprop() the activation is changing as we move from image1 to image 2 and so on till image 10
